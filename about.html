                    </h2>
                    <p>Better Tomorrow is a 501(c) 3 nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote opportunities for those
                        less fortunate by rehabilitating vacant and blighted properties into affordable and market-rate housing.
                        To ease the transition, Helping Hands Philadelphia will implement a variety of community development
                        initiatives that will provide added revenue to local businesses, establish after-school programs
                        for students, as well as facilitate the development of employment opportunities through educational
                        training for local residents. After appropriately identifying deteriorating or vacant properties,
                        Helping Hands Philadelphia will employ Act 135 to undertake constructive action to redress property
                        neglect. To this end, Helping Hands Philadelphia seeks to form partnerships with leading developers
                        and sources of financing in order to facilitate the reuse of deteriorated and blighted properties.
                        The aim of Helping Hands Philadelphia is to improve the overall standard of living, promote and initiate
                        opportunities for job creation, stimulate economic and financial growth, and provide increased educational
                        opportunities.

                                constituting the greatest disparity since the Twenties, will be long and arduous. However,
                                as with all enormous problems, a viable solution is achieved by taking one small step at
                                a time. We believe that part of the answer to this problem rests in the drastic improvement
                                of our infrastructure.</p>
